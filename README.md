# L.A. Parker - Jared Waine's MERN stack project

This project was created using the following technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, JavaScript, and Google Maps API. Please refer to the Screenshots folder for some visuals of the project in action.

## About

This project is intended for letting users find, create, and update free street parking spots in Los Angeles.

## Map

Throughout the application, there is an interactive map that displays markers of parking spots previously added to the database. Clicking on a marker gives the details for the spot, like street sweeping hours.

## Home Page

The user can search for spots by neighborhood or zip code or click on the Create button to add a new spot to the database.

## Search results

Searching by neighborhood or zip code provides a list of results of spots based on what street they're on and between which cross streets. The user can click on each link to see details.

## Details page

Allows the user to see details of a specific spot and even delete it from the database if it is no longer viable. Clicking the edit button takes the user to the edit page.

## Edit page

Here the user can edit the details for the spot, like street sweeping times.

## Create page

The user can fill out the form to create a spot. Using the handy directions above the map, the user can place a custom marker on the map for their spot and click on it to grab latitude and longitude information that they can place into the form in order to create a permanent marker on the map.
